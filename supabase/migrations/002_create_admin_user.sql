-- Create admin user
-- Note: This will create the user in Supabase Auth
-- The password will be hashed automatically by Supabase

-- Insert user directly into auth.users (this is a simplified approach)
-- In production, you should use Supabase Dashboard or API to create users
-- For now, we'll create a function that can be called to create the user

-- This migration creates a helper function, but the actual user creation
-- should be done through Supabase Dashboard or API
-- However, we can prepare the user data structure

-- The user will be created through the Supabase Dashboard or via the signup flow
-- This migration is just a placeholder to document the admin user requirement
